The master thesis is one of the biggest achievements that I have accomplished. The initial Knowledge I have on the thesis and the problems faced due to covid makes the master thesis more challenging. In every stage, I faced many challenges. Some of the challenges are finding a supervisor related to the domain (Machine Learning) that I want to work on. Finds difficult to get an appointment with the supervisor due to covid problems. Handling the pressure and time management at the final stage. By overcoming all the challenges, I completed my master's these within time. During this project, I also learned so many things and gained knowledge from my supervisor in some areas. The feedback from my supervisor helps me to move forward by correcting previous mistakes.

Recently, I read the book Effective DevOps with AWS Ship faster, scale better, and deliver incredible productivity written by Nathaniel Felsen.
